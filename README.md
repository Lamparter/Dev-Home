Dev Home is a new experience from Microsoft aiming to give developers more power on Windows.
It contains multiple powerful tools to give developers on Windows the best experience.

Microsoft [officially announced](https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/pull/4028) they would be deprecating Dev Home on the 27th of January 2025.
Just a couple days later, this repo was made and work continuing Dev Home began immediately.
Any contribution is welcome, and please provide feedback!

## Installing Dev Home

> ~~If you are running Windows 11 23H2 (build 22621.2361) or later, you can install and run Dev Home just by finding it in the Start menu.~~

You can install [Dev Home from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/devhome).
For users who are unable to install Dev Home from the Microsoft Store, released builds can be manually downloaded from this repository's [Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/releases).

## Dev Home overview

Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code:

### Dashboard

The Dev Home dashboard displays Windows widgets. These widgets are built using the Windows widget platform, which relies on Adaptive Cards.

### Machine configuration

The machine configuration tool utilizes the Dev Home GitHub Extension, but isn't required to clone and install apps. The app installation tool is powered by winget.

#### Popular apps

The machine configuration tool provides a list of popular apps when selecting applications to install. This is currently a hard-coded list of applications that have been popular with developers on Windows. Popularity was determined by high levels of installation and usage. As this is a moment in time, we are not accepting submissions for this list. We're looking to improve the experience with [Suggested Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/issues/375) so the list can be optimized for developers.
